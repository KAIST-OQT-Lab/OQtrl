This is a repository for the development of a Python-based experiment control interface for OQT quantum experiments.

This project includes the development of the following

- Developing an 'ADbasic process' for real-time ADwin system control
- Develop a Python-based interface for real-time ADwin system control
- Experimental Sequence controller development
- Develop a front-end GUI for the experiment
- Developed Dashboard for experiment monitoring

Our project is using `Python 3.11.6` and `ADwin software package 6.00.34.00`

You can download dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
